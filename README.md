# hello-world

Hi guys!

I want to learn how to program in C++, C and Python. I have intermediate experience with MATLAB but that's about it. 
Through the learning process, I hope to at least get the basics of coding down and would like to use this knowledge in data analysis and process modelling and simulation.
